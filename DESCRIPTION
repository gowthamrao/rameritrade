Description: R package to interface with the TD Ameritrade API that can be
    found at https://developer.tdameritrade.com/. This package contains a
    suite of functions that allow for authentication, trading, price requests,
    account information etc. In order to use this package you will need to
    register a TD Ameritrade developer app following the link above. You will also need
    a TD Ameritrade brokerage account to link to your app. See the README for 
    more details. PLease note, the fate of the TD Ameritrade API is in question
    after the Schwab acquisition. Hopefully the API stays in tact and this 
    package will be updated if needed.
