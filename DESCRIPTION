Description: Use R to interface with the TD Ameritrade API. Functions facilitate authentication,
    trading, price requests, account information, etc. A user will need a TD Brokerage 
    account and TD Ameritrade developer app. Please note, the fate of the TD Ameritrade API is
    in question after the Charles Schwab acquisition, but there is optimism the API will remain.
