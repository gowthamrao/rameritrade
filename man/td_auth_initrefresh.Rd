\title{Get an initial Refresh Token using the Authorization code URL}
\usage{
td_auth_initrefresh(
  authcode_url,
  callbackURL,
  consumerKey,
  verbose_output = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{authcode_url}{Authorization URL Code generated from a successful login to the td_auth_initurl}

\item{callbackURL}{User generated Callback URL associated with registered TD app}

\item{consumerKey}{TD generated Consumer key associated with registered TD app}
}
\value{
refresh token that is valid for 90 days
}
\description{
Once a URL has been generated using td_auth_initurl, a user can log into a 
TD brokerage account, granting access to the TD app. A successful log in 
will result in an authorization code embedded in the URL which will be fed
into this function. Once the button "Allow" is pressed, the user will be
redirected, potentially to "This site can't be reached". This indicates a
successful log in. The URL of the page contains the authorization code.
Paste the entire URL, not just the authorization code into this function.
The code will be an extremely long alpha numeric string.
}
\details{
The output of this function will be a refresh token which will be used
to gain access to the TD Brokerage account going forward. A successful 
submission will show "HTTP/1.1 200 OK" in the console with a verbose output.
The Refresh Token will last for 90 days, but you can use td_auth_getrefresh to 
reset the token before expiration. If the Refresh Token expires, a new
authorization code will need to be generated. 

The Refresh Token output should be saved in a very safe location, but
also accessible. It will be needed to generate an access token (which 
expire every 30 minutes) which is used in most of the functions within
this package.

\examples{
\dontrun{

### The URL after a successful login can be fed into the function below
refToken = td_auth_geturl('https://YourAppName/?code=Auhtorizationcode','https://YourAppName','CONSUMERKEY')

saveRDS(refToken,'/secure/location/')

}
